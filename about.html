        Hi, my name is Kayden... 
        </h1>
        <p> 
        and I am a sophomore undergraduate student at Rice University in Houston.
        For my degress, I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering and a Bachelors of Arts in 
        Visual and Performing Arts with a Concentration in Studio Art. My future career interests include consulting,
        entreprenuership, scientific art conservation, and sustainability-focused engineering. <br><br>
    
        I created this website over Winter Break of 2022 with the intention of exploring html, CSS, and Javascript
        in order to expand my personal skillset in order to eventually work with web and phone-based applications.
        As you explore the limited expanses of this website, I hope you like the downloadable resume with 
        preview, the project gallery, and the contact form that creates secure messages sent to me. <br><br>

        This is all I have to say, so if you have any questions about the website or myself, please fill out the form or use the email located
        under the contact tab. <br> :)
